# Determine-the-species-of-a-seedling

Python is used to do all the process, training, and testing for plant Seedings Classification dataset. All the processes are done using Python3 Google Colab. To tackle this problem, I used deep learning approach. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning algorithms that use multiple layers to extract higher level features from raw data. One of deep learning algorithm is Convolution Neural Network (CNN) which is a class of deep neural networks. CNN showed high learning performance of detecting objects using huge ImageNet datasets. CNN is a feed forward neural network which takes fixed size inputs and generates fixed size outputs, CNNs are easier to train because they have much fewer connections and parameters.
CNN Model Architecture:
Neural network is a multilayer perceptron of artificial nodes. 
Each node has weighted input data, pass it to an activation function and output node for the result.
CNN model architecture has three layers:
•	Input layer which will take the image data in form of a matrix.
•	Hidden layers which will allow neural network to learn complex features within the data.
•	Output layer that will give the outcome.
